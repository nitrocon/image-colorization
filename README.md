Thanks a lot for youre paper in GANs and the code youre sharing with us, that helped a lot making this App.

Tested with python 3.12, py version is limited to fastAI compatibility
I am using https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby and https://git-scm.com/downloads/win to run the windows App.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitrocon/supercolor.git
cd supercolor
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python maingui.py
```
